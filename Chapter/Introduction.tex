In this lab, our team set out to build BT Network, a small version of Tier-2 Internet Service Provider (ISP) located at Haslegrave Building, from scratch. Despite its limitations in terms of size and Internet access, we can proudly attest that BT Network is one of the leading providers at Haslegrave Building.

BT network is a Autonomous System (AS) as a whole and the AS Number is \texttt{2030}. Its domain name is \texttt{bt.lboro} .
