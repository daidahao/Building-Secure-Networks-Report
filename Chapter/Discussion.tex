\section{Conclusions}
Several conclusions can be drawn from this lab.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  BT Network, a small Tier-2 ISP, has been built and well tested. 
\item
  BT Network provides both intra-domain and inter-domain Internet connection to its users. It serves common Internet applications including Web, DNS and Email as well.
\item
  BT Network forms and implements business relationships with neighbouring ISPs.
\item
  Both IS-IS and BGP routing protocols can provide alternative route(s) to the destination when one of the physicial links is down.  
\end{enumerate}


\section{Further Work}

For the future, the following improvements are being considered.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Implement the alternative \textbf{next-hop solution} instead of "passive interface" as in Section \ref{sec:isis-alternative}.
\item
  Fully test the implementation of BGP routing in IPv6. We are unable to test it as no neighbouring ISP has set up IPv6 BGP routing as far as we know.
\item
  Provide other Internet services such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\citep{rfc2131} and File Transfer Protocol (FTP)\citep{rfc959}.
\end{enumerate}
