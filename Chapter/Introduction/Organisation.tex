\section{Organisation of the Report}
\label{sec:organisation}

The report is organised as follows. The architecture of BT Network on the network layer is described in Chapter \ref{chap:architecture}. A Network Diagram involving all physical components and connections is drawn in the chapter. Then, IP addresses for interfaces in the network are carefully allocated and configured. 

In order to allow packets to be forwarded within and outside the network, proper intra-domain and inter-domain routing protocols are implemented and tested in Chapter \ref{chap:routing}. 

In Chapter \ref{chap:applications}, we move up to the application layer and set up various services in the network as listed in Section \ref{sec:services}.

Main conclusions drawn from the building process and possible further improvements are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:discussion}. At last, a summary of contributions for each team member is presented in Chapter \ref{chap:contributions}.

Although the report does not necessarily reflect the actural order of steps in our building process (eg. remote SSH access was set up before BGP), readers can be assured that all results presented can be reproduced by following the natural order of the report.

To ensure readability, rationale behind important decisions made, problems we encountered and their respective solutions, alternative ways of configurations (if any) as well as reflective commentary are documented along with each step of implementation in the report.
