\chapter*{Abstract}
This report describes the building process of BT Network, a small version of Tier-2 Internet Service Provider.
To first define the architecture of the network, a network diagram is drawn, in which physical connections are established and IP addresses are assigned. 
Then, connectivity within the network and with outside networks are made possible through internal routing protocol Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and external Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
In addition, services such as World Wide Web (WWW), Domain Name System (DNS) and Email are provided in the network.
At last, main conclusions and further improvements are discussed.
